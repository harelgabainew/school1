        "In these exercises you will gain some experience with methods for efficient similarity search. A naive similarity search requires a brute-force computation of all pairwise distances, in the chosen metrics. The brute-force approach is not scalable with computational complexity for $n$ observations of $O(n^2)$.    \n",
        "\n",
        "For massive datasets we need much more efficient methods. These methods fall into two broad categories. First **exact similarity search** or **exact nearest neighbor search** methods try to find the $k$ observations closest to a query vector, $q$. However, even the most efficient exact similarity search methods do not scale to high dimensional massive datasets. In order to perform similarity search on massive high-dimensional datasets we must use **approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS)** algorithms. As you will see, ANNS algorithms involve compromises between query speed, memory use and accuracy. Whereas, exact methods are expected to have a recall score of 1.0, we must expect lower recall from ANNS algorithms as the price paid for high query speed and low memory use.            \n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we will explore several widely used possibilities:        \n",
        "1. [**KD trees**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) are a widely used tree-based data structure used for low-dimensional data. KD-trees are constructed from recursive binary splits. For a dataset with $n$ observations and dimensionality, $d$, the computational complexity is $O\\big(d\\ n \\log(n) \\big)$. While not ideal linear scaling, $O(n)$, the KD tree is a significant improvement over brute-force methods. Generally, KD-trees are considered to be efficient for large datasets with $d \\le 20$. For higher dimensional data, R-trees and ball trees can be extended to higher dimensional data. We will apply ball trees for clustering and dimensionality reduction with the spectral clustering and UMAP algorithms.     \n",
        "2. [**Inverted Indexes**](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/vector-indexes/) are a course quantization method that divides a large search space. Inverted indexes can be search very quickly but do not achieve high recall rates. Typically, these algorithms are used in conjunction with finer search algorithms.    \n",
        "3. [**Product Quantization (PQ)**](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/product-quantization/) employs multi-level vector quantization. The PQ algorithm is provides fast queries with reasonable levels of recall. In addition, the PQ algorithm requires minimal memory, providing up to 97% compression!\n",
        "4. [**Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)** graphs](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/) are arguably the state of the art in ANNS. These algorithms use a hierarchy of graphs of increasing detail and accuracy. There is a trade-off between memory use query speed and recall (accuracy) for HNSW. Properly configured, HNSW can achieve high recall scores with reasonable scalability.\n",
        "5. [**Composite Indices**](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/composite-indexes/) use pipelines of to improve end to end performance, recall, query speed and memory use. These composites start with coarse quantization with inverted indices (IVF) and work toward fine ANN search in two or more steps. The number of possible pipeline combinations is quite large. In practice, there are a smaller number of widely used composites which are empirically known to work well for many problems.      \n",

The difference is big, in diffrent magnitude. the construction time grows exponentially while query time grows very slowly .This demonstrates that n logn complexity scales much worse than logn complexity.

According to the scalability analysis, it would only take roughly 2.53 times longer to query a KD-tree with 10 million samples than it would to query our present little dataset. If we assume that the current query takes milliseconds, obtaining the top 100 closest neighbors from 10 million instances should take less than 20 seconds, even with a 2.53x increase. The log n query complexity implies that once the tree is formed, you can search through even very large datasets quickly."

        "> 1. The benchmark results compare the IVF approximate search against the exact flat index as ground truth, measuring what fraction of true nearest neighbors are correctly identified. The at k values represent how many of the top k neighbors we are  evaluating, and recall is always < 1 because the approximate IVF method uses Voronoi cell centroids rather than exact distances, inevitably missing some true nearest neighbors.      \n",
        "> 2. When we raise the `n_prob`, the algorithm has to look for more Voronoi cells than simply the closest centroid. This makes the search space larger by include vectors that could be closer but were allocated to cells next to them.  This larger search makes it more likely that we wil locate the real closest neighbors that we would have missed if you simply looked in the single nearest Voronoi cell.       \n",
        "> 3. When `n_prob` is higher, we have to search through more Voronoi cells for each query, which means we have to do more distance computations. Searching 16 cells takes a lot longer than searching simply 1 cell since each extra cell investigated adds to the computing load.    \n",
        "> 4. The inverted index predivides the data into Voronoi regions, allowing queries to search only inside a limited portion of the total vectors in those located in the adjacent cells.  The flat index must calculate distances to all 1 million vectors, while IVF often examines just a few thousand vectors each cell.\n",
        "> 5. we could increase nlist, the number of Voronoi cells. because additional cells make the search area smaller, which makes it less likely that comparable vectors will end up in different cells. Each cell has uniform vectors as there are more cells. This makes the centroid based approximation more accurate.          "

Increasing nbits from 8 to 10 only adds more quantization levels to the same subvectors, but the asymmetric distance calculation still approximates distances using the same coarse subvector partitions. The fundamental limitation comes from the subvector quantization structure itself, not the precision of the centroids.      \n",

        "> 3.Increasing m creates more independent subvectors, which lets us get a better approximation of the original vectors and lowers quantization error across multiple dimensions.  But if you want additional subvectors, we will need to store more centroid tables, which will use a lot more memory than adding precision to the ones we already have."

To start, fill in the table shown with the performance characteristics of the algorithms, memory used, total time for 1000 queries, recall@20 for the 1000 queries and recall@100 for the 1000 queries. You need only report the results to 2 significant digits.

In general, algorithms that get higher recall use a lot more memory and take a lot longer to run queries. On the other hand, memory efficient algorithms like PQ versions. give up some memory performance.    \n",
        "> 2. The PQ algorithm with m=8, nbits=10 has the longest query time at 36.6 seconds per query, with good memory efficiency but creating impractical performance due to the computational overhead of product quantization with higher bit precision.  \n",

The trade offs include much higher memory usage and slightly reduced recall compared to exact search, as HNSW achieves speed through its graph based hierarchical structure that enables efficient approximate nearest neighbor search at the cost of substantial memory overhead.
