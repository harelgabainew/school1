    "In this assignment you will work with some basic streaming analytic algorithms. To avoid the complexities of installing and setting up a real streaming analytics platform, you will work with stream flow data loaded from local files. Specifically in this assignment you will:    \n",
    "1. Create and apply code to perform basic stream queries.    \n",
    "2. Using stream queries and plots, explore the stream data.    \n",
    "3. Use moving windows to compute moving averages and sub-sample a stream.    \n",
    "4. Use exponential decay filters to compute moving averages and sub-sample a stream.    \n",
    "5. Work with a Bloom and quotient filters to filter for customer identifiers on a list.\n",
    "6. Use the count-min-sketch algorithm to find counts of unique event identifiers.\n",
    "7. Use the HyperLogLog algorithm to find the cardinality of events in a stream.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains over 13,500 stream flow gauges in the United States. Measurements from most of these gauges are recorded every 15 min and uploaded every 4 hours are [available for download](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt). Stream flow data are used as inputs for complex water management tasks for purposes such as agriculture, residential use and conservation. For this assignment you will work with the time series of measurements for two stream flow gauges on tributaries of the the Columbia River in the US State of Washington.     \n",

    "To get started, execute the code in the cell below to import the packages you will need. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You must pip install four packages to run the code in this notebook. You can perform the installation of these packages by uncommenting the shell commands shown in the cell below. Alternatively, you can also Conda install these packages.    \n",
    "> 1. [Mmh3](https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3)      \n",
    "> 2. [Bitarray](https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray)\n",
    "> 3. [PyProbables](https://pyprobables.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "> 4. [Datasketch](https://ekzhu.com/datasketch/index.html)\n",
    "> 5. [DataSketches](https://apache.github.io/datasketches-python/5.2.0/index.html)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The three packages, PyProbables, Datasketch and Apache DataSketches have considerable overlap in the algorithms available. Of the three, Apache DataSketches is considered most suitable for enterprise scale deployments. For example, [DataSketches is integrated with BigQuery](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-bigquery) and [Apache SPARK](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-spark). Unfortunately, the DataSketches' Python API is incomplete and poorly documented. Therefore, we will use several sketch packages in these exercises.     "

    "## Filtering Discrete Events  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases our goal is to filter discrete events based on some type of identifier. The identifier is a hash of nearly any hashable data type. Many examples of these data types include, string customers identifiers, numeric event identifiers, IP addresses, email addresses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of such a method is the [**Bloom filter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter). A Bloom filter is quite efficient in terms of computing and memory.  However, the Bloom filter does not allow for deleting matches once they are added to the hash table. An alternative is a **[quotient filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_filter)**. The quotient filter keeps a count of events for each hash. As a result, an event identifier can be removed from the table by decrementing the counts for the hashes. To perform this extra operation the quotient filter uses more memory and is a bit less computationally efficient.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Both Bloom filters and quotient filters operate by the same principle. A hash table of key-values pairs is created. The keys are the hashes of the event identifiers. For a Bloom filter, the value is binary, the event is in the table or it is not. The quotient filter on the other hand, maintains a count of events in each bucket. The count can be incremented as new instances are encountered, or decremented when deleting events.     \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will construct a Bloom filter using a bit array and the Python [mmh3 package](https://github.com/hajimes/mmh3?tab=readme-ov-file).

    "The empirical estimation of quantiles of unknown distributions is a fundamental problem in data mining. Quantiles estimates have many uses in data mining. One example is a median estimate for some time period of a stream. As another example, one can use extreme quantiles of time intervals of a stream to monitor for anomalies. There are many other applications. As yet another example, quantile estimation is used to evaluate performance of networks and server clusters as well as for cybersecurity monitoring.        \n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this notebook we will apply two of the many possible algorithms quantile estimation sketch algorithms; the widely used [t-digest algorithm of Dunning and Ertl, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04023), and the [Relative Error Streaming Quantile algorithm of Cormode, et. al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01668).    \n",
    "\n",
    "These quantile estimation sketches are **mergeable**. As a result, one can construct a hierarchy of time intervals from shorter to longer.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For the exercises in this notebook you will apply both of these algorithms to the one of the stream flow time series. You will apply this the quantile estimation sketches to 24 hour periods. These 24 hours sketches will be merged into 20 day intervals.    "

    "The [**t-digest sketch algorithm**}(https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04023) is based on an heuristic model. Consequently, there are no know analytical error bounds on the performance of the t-digest algorithm. Empirical tests show that the t-digest algorithm reliably produces accurate results, particularly at extreme quantiles.          \n",

The scale function favor samples at extreme values, thereby reducing the error of estimating extreme quantiles at the expense of accuracy of the mid-range quantiles. The scale function has one parameter, $\\delta$, which controls the number of centroids. Larger $\\delta$ leads to a larger sketch with more accurate quantile estimates.    \n",
