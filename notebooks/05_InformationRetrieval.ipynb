    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Document search is a core data mining methodology. For example, document search is an essential component of solutions like web search, recommender systems and RAG algorithms for constraining results from large language models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a simple example of vector document search. The search approach used in this notebook is deliberately restricted. A real-world solution would be considerably more complex. In this case, the search is performed in two simple stages.    \n",
    "1. An approximate vector search using a scaleable index.\n",
    "2. A reranking or refinement step using a more exact, but slower algorithm, applied the results of the first search.   \n",
    "\n",
    "These steps can both be accomplished with dense text embedding. In other cases a hybrid of sparse and dense embedding methods is applied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As one might expect, production quality search systems require a great deal more sophistication than is applied here. Further, we pursue only one of many possible architectures to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we use for retrieval here is truly unsupervised. We have no known rankings. For these situations, evaluation of retrieval solutions presents a significant problem. Indeed we have no objective basis for evaluation. Even if we went to the time and expense of creating a limited set of human rankings, the result would likely be biased in some way. An alternative is to compare these results to other approaches. For example, one could compare rankings to those produced by one or more LLMs. Even here, there is no way to know how good or biased the valuation performed is. In the interest of simplicity and limited effort, we will not attempt any evaluation here. Rather, we are limited to some subjective evaluation.       "

In summary two of several possible approaches are:    \n",
