    "# Assignment 01 - Pitfalls in Data Mining     \n",
    "## CSCI E-108\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of data mining is to find important relationships in large complex datasets. These dataset typically contain a large number of variables. The **high-dimensional** nature of the data leads to some commonly encountered pitfalls which lead to incorrect inferences.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will gain a bit of experience with three important concepts in data mining at a small scale. These methods are essential as the scale increases:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False Discovery Rate Control:** The goal of data mining is to find important relationships in large complex datasets. These dataset typically contain a large number of variables. The **high-dimensional** nature of the data leads to some commonly encountered pitfalls of incorrect inference, **false discovery**. A related problem is cutting off a large-scale analysis when a desired relationship is 'found'. This practice of **p-value mining** often leads to unwarranted inferences. You will apply false discovery rate (FDR) control methods to address this problem.   \n",
    "2. **Key-Value Pairs:** Large scale data is typically managed using key-value (KV) pairs. The exercises in this assignment give you some experience working with KV pair data management.  \n",
    "3. **Map and Reduce Processes:** Much of large scale data mining requires use of a split-apply-combine approach. The data is split into manageable chunks, analytic transformations are applied, and the result combined or aggregated. A commonly used class of a split-apply-combine algorithm is MapReduce. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep the scope of this assignment manageable, you will use limited versions of KV pair management and MapReduce. Specifically, you will use common Python tools to implement these concepts rather than dedicated large scale analytic platforms. "

    "## Multiple Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing multiple hypothesis in high-dimensional data is problematic. Exhaustively testing all pairwise relationships between variables in a data set is a commonly used, but generally misleading, from of **multiple comparisons**. The chance of finding false significance, using such a **data dredging** approach, can be surprisingly high. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will perform multiple comparisons on **only 20 identically distributed independent (iid)** variables. Ideally, such tests should not find significant relationships, but the actual result is quite different. \n",
